# creation-crate
[Creation Crate](https://mycreationcrate.com/) is a monthly subscription box service.  Each month you recieve a [Arduino UNO R3](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno) and parts to complete a project.  The instruction book includes source code for the project.

This repository is for storing the sketch files I type up from the project instructions.
