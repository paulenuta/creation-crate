# creation-crate
[Creation Crate](https://mycreationcrate.com/) is a monthly subscription box service.  Each month you recieve a [Arduino UNO R3](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno) and parts to complete a project.  The instruction book includes source code for the project.

This repository is for storing sketch files I type up from the project instructions.

## The Projects

### Month 1 - Mood Lamp
[mood_lamp.ino](https://github.com/townsean/creation-crate/blob/master/sketches/mood_lamp/mood_lamp.ino) is a lamp that changes colors and only turns on when it's dark.

### Month 2 - Memory Game

[memory_game.ino](https://github.com/townsean/creation-crate/blob/master/sketches/memory_game/memory_game.ino) is a memory game.  Users match the pattern of the LEDs with button presses.

(It looks like I correctly matched the pattern here, but I did not press the blue button hard enough and it did not pick up on the input.)

### Month 3 - Distance Detector

[distance_detector.ino](https://github.com/townsean/creation-crate/blob/master/sketches/distance_detector/distance_detector.ino) is a distance detector.  With the help of an ultrasonic sensor, the Arduino will provide visual (LEDs) and audio (buzzer) indicators of how away an object is.

### Month 4 - LED Dice Game

[led_dice_game.ino](https://github.com/townsean/creation-crate/blob/master/sketches/led_dice_game/led_dice_game.ino) simulates the roll of a 6-sided die.
